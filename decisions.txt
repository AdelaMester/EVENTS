First decision made was to make a simple and clear app thus I created a homepage with three menu buttons: "Create events", "Events", "Ticket status".
Created db "events.db" to be able to save the events.

"Create events"
  Created the route and template.
  Implemented a function that creates a unique token for each ticket, whenever an event is created with X number of tickets. In addition, created the table "tickets" in my db that stores all the unique ticket tokens.

"Events"
  Decided to redirect the results of creating events on the "Events" page where they will be displayed in a table. 
  Created a dynamic route for each event in order to display its details (Initial tickets, Redeemed tickets, Add tickets, Refresh counter).
  "Events/event_id"
    Created functionality for the buttons ("Add tickets", "Refresh counter") and added logic in the corresponding routes.
    Displayed all ticket tokens belonging to the selected event.
  
  
  
 "Ticket status"
    Created template and appropriate route.
    Displayed ticket status.
