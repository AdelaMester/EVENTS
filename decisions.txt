First decision made was to make a simple and clear app thus I created a homepage with three menu buttons: "Create events", "Events", "Ticket status".
Created db "events.db" to be able to save the events.
"Create events"
  Created the route and template.

"Events"
  Decided to redirect the results of creating events on the "Events" page where they will be displayed in a table. 
  Created a dynamic route for each event in order to display its details (Initial tickets, Redeemed tickets, Add tickets, Refresh counter).
  "Events/event_id"
    Created functionality for the buttons ("Add tickets", "Refresh counter") and added logic in the corresponding routes.
  
  
  
 "Ticket status"
    Created template and appropriate route.
