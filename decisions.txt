First decision made was to make a simple and clear app thus I created a homepage with three menu buttons: "Create events", "Events", "Ticket status".
Created db "events.db" to be able to save the events.
"Created events"

"Events"
  Decided to redirect the results of creating events on the "Events" page where they will be displayed in a table. 
  
 "Ticket status"
